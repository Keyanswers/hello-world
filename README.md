My version of Hello World

This R code creates a sequence X ranging from 1 to 7 and defines two text strings Text1 and Text2. It then uses a for loop to iterate over the elements of the sequence. Inside the loop, it checks if the current element i is less than 7. If true, it prints the content of Text1; otherwise, it prints the content of Text2. The loop essentially prints the content of Text1 for the first six iterations (when i is less than 7) and then prints the content of Text2 for the seventh iteration.
